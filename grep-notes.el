;; The `grep-notes' command provides a quick & easy way to view notes associated
;; with the current context. The `grep-notes-file-assoc' option is used to specify
;; which file to use for grepping based on the current major-mode or some other
;; condition.
;; 
;;;;;;;;

;;; Commands:
;;
;; Below is a complete list of commands:
;;
;;  `grep-notes'
;;    grep for matches to REGEX between STARTLINE and ENDLINE in FILE.
;;    Keybinding: M-x grep-notes
;;
;;; Customizable Options:
;;
;; Below is a list of customizable options:
;;
;;  `grep-notes-default-file'
;;    Default file to use for `grep-notes' command when there is no file associated with 
;;    default = "~/.emacs.d/notes/programming.org"
;;  `grep-notes-file-assoc'
;;    Assoc list of the form (COND . (FILE START END)) for use with `grep-notes' command.
;;    default = nil

;;
;; All of the above can be customized by:
;;      M-x customize-group RET grep-notes RET
;;

;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put grep-notes.el in a directory in your load-path, e.g. ~/.emacs.d/
;; You can add a directory to your load-path with the following line in ~/.emacs
;; (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
;; where ~/elisp is the directory you want to add 
;; (you don't need to do this for ~/.emacs.d - it's added by default).
;;
;; Add the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.

;; (require 'grep-notes)

If nil then `grep-notes' will prompt for the file.
If a directory then `grep-notes' will prompt for a file within that directory."

(defcustom grep-notes-default-options "-i"
  "Extra options for grep searches when no extra options are given by `grep-notes-file-assoc' entry.

(defcustom grep-notes-file-assoc nil
  "Assoc list of the form (COND . (FILE REGIONS OPTIONS)) for use with `grep-notes' command.
COND can be either a major-mode symbol or an sexp which evaluates to non-nil
in buffers of the required type. FILE is the file to be grepped, or a glob pattern for
matching multiple files (but in this case REGIONS will not be respected).
REGIONS is a list of region specifications, each of which can take one of the following
forms:
 1) a regexp matching an org header (without initial stars or whitespace, can include tags)
 2) a cons cell of regexps matching the start and end of the region
 3) a cons cell of start and end line numbers for the region
 4) a function which takes the current major-mode as argument and returns one of the 
    aforementioned types. For example if the function is `symbol-name' then the associated
    regions will be org-headers named by the major-mode.
If REGIONS is empty then the whole file will be used.
OPTIONS is a string containing extra options for grep."
